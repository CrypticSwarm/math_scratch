Prime decomposition
===================

Requirements
------------

You will need to have Docker installed and be able to run `make` commands.

Run
---

To open the notebook environment run:

```sh
make nb
```

To override the port that Jupyter Labs opens on, optionally add a `port` argument (e.g., 8887).

```sh
make nb port=8887
```
